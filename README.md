# Satellite

Satellite is a simple, file-based toolkit for websites. It is something between a static site and flat-file content management systems like [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) or [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/).

> Note: This is a very early version and not ready for real world usage.

## Features

* Runs on every server with PHP 7
* Templates are powered by [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/)
* Support for multiple languages
* Support for multiple sites and domains
* Easy to update, backup, and restore
